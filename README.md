# random-number-generator
A random number generator.

Click the button and it picks a number randomly between one and six.

The generated number is added to a list in a separate text file.
On every press of the button, the application reads through this text file to ensure there are no dupicate numbers.
If the number is a duplicate, it prompts you to retry.

You can edit the code to have more numbers if you'd like.

This is my very first Python project! Coded it all by myself with some helpful docs :)
